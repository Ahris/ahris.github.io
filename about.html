  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently working as an embedded software engineer in San Francisco. I spend all of my free time on projects and video games. My areas of interest include computer graphics, embedded software, and rom hacking. JRPGs hold a special place in my heart, especially Final Fantasy and Fire Emblem.

    This site features the projects I've been working on. The heart at the top of the page in the navigation bar links to my tutorials and blog posts!
