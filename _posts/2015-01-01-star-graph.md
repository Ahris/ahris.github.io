This site renders a universe of Metacritic video game scores, made with Javascript and WebGL. The stars represent video games and the ones closer to the center of the galaxy have better scores on Metacritic. The site pulls in a few hundred random games from various platforms. You can use it to discover new games!

Jordan Mecom and I pair coded this project during our winter break in 2014. The goal of this project was to learn WebGL and to create a visualization of something we loved - video games!

## Usage

View it [here](https://jmecom.github.io/star-graph/)! Unfortunately, it's currently broken due to deprecated APIs. :-( You can still mouse around the empty universe though.
